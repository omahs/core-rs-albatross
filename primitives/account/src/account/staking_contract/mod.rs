/// The struct representing the staking contract. The staking contract is a special contract that
/// handles most functions related to validators and staking.
/// The overall staking contract is a subtrie in the AccountsTrie that is composed of several
/// different account types. Each different account type is intended to store a different piece of
/// data concerning the staking contract. By having the path to each account you can navigate the
/// staking contract subtrie. The subtrie has the following format:
///
/// ```text
/// STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: StakingContract
///     |--> PREFIX_VALIDATOR || VALIDATOR_ADDRESS: Validator
///     |--> PREFIX_TOMBSTONE || VALIDATOR_ADDRESS: Tombstone
///     |
///     |--> PREFIX_STAKER || STAKER_ADDRESS: Staker
/// ```
///
/// So, for example, if you want to get the validator with a given address then you just fetch the
/// node with key STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS||PATH_VALIDATORS_LIST||VALIDATOR_ADDRESS||PATH_VALIDATOR_MAIN
/// from the AccountsTrie (|| means concatenation).
/// At a high level, the Staking Contract subtrie contains:
///     - The Staking contract main. A struct that contains general information about the Staking contract.
///     - A list of Validators. Each of them is a subtrie containing the Validator struct, with all
///       the information relative to the Validator.
///     - A list of Stakers, with each Staker struct containing all information about a staker.
